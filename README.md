# DYSFUNCTIONAL

This is non-functional at the moment, I'll be working on it tho.

# Cubical Script

This is a vscode extension made to let you write and edit scripts for Facility AI in [The Perfect Tower II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1197260/The_Perfect_Tower_II/).

## Features

This extension is non-functional, as it doesn't have any real logic inside of it.<br>
Here is what I hope to cover:

- Syntax similar to that seen in the [external editor by d0sboots](https://github.com/d0sboots/perfect-tower)
- Source export/import capabilities, using files and folders for organization.
- Replace the {lua()} macro with the {compute()} macro. This replaces the lua interpreter with a c++ syntax that I find easier to work with.

At this moment, the only thing this extension can do is syntax highlighting.

## Requirements

There are no requirements as of now, I'll leave this here just in case something comes up.

## Extension Settings

The extension is so minimal that there are no settings yet.<br>
Just like with [Requirements](#requirements), I won't remove this section just to keep the organization.

## Known Issues

The only issue is that this thing is dysfunctional.

## Release Notes

Under construction.<br>
Beta versions only, doccumented in the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

### 1.0.0
